# Day 13: Debugging - How to Find and Fix Errors in Your Code

## Overview
Today focused on understanding the debugging process—how to systematically find and fix errors in Python code using both manual and automated techniques.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Describing the Problem:** Writing out what your code is supposed to do.
- **Reproducing Bugs:** How to consistently trigger errors.
- **Play Computer:** Manually stepping through code as if you were the interpreter.
- **Error Recognition:** Spotting and understanding syntax and logic errors.
- **Using `print()` Statements:** A simple but effective tool for tracing bugs.
- **Python Debugger (`debug` tool):** How to set breakpoints and inspect variables.
- **Final Debugging Tips:** Best practices for isolating and solving problems.


## Takeaways
- Debugging is a **learnable skill**, not just a reaction to failure.
- Be methodical: observe, isolate, reproduce, then fix.
- The `print()` function is often your best friend when starting out.
- PyCharm’s debugger makes deeper inspection and control much easier.
