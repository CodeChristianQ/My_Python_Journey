# Day 5: Python Loops & Password Generator Project

##  Topics Covered

On Day 5 of the "100 Days of Code: Python" course, I deepened my understanding of Python loops and applied this knowledge to build a fully functional password generator.

###  Loops in Python
- Learned how to iterate over lists using `for` loops.
- Practiced finding the highest value in a list using loop logic.
- Explored the `range()` function and how it can be combined with loops to control iteration.
- Applied loop concepts in a classic coding exercise: **FizzBuzz**.

###  Project: Password Generator
- Built a password generator that creates strong, randomized passwords using:
  - Letters (uppercase & lowercase)
  - Numbers
  - Symbols
- Implemented randomness using the `random` module (`random.choice`, `random.shuffle`).
- Reinforced list manipulation, string concatenation, and user input handling.

## Key Takeaways

- Loops allow powerful automation over lists and ranges.
- The `range()` function is flexible for defining custom sequences.
- Cleanly structuring logic with loops helps build scalable solutions.
- Practice with real-world projects (like a password generator) makes abstract concepts tangible.
