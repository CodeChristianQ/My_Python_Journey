# Day 22: Pong Arcade Game 🎮 - Intermediate Python Project

Welcome to Day 22 of the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp!  
Today’s project brought the classic **Pong** game to life using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and **Python’s Turtle module**. This section was a fantastic exercise in managing game logic, user input, and collision detection.

## ✅ What I Learned

- Setting up a visual game screen using Turtle
- Creating multiple classes to handle different game components
- Handling real-time key events for player input
- Detecting collision logic between the ball and paddles
- Managing game score, boundaries, and object speed

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

| * | Topic |
|---|-------|
|*| Defined the project goal and expected outcome |
|*| Initialized the game screen using Turtle |
|*| Created a Paddle that responds to user key presses |
|*| Built a Paddle class and created both player paddles |
|*| Wrote the Ball class and implemented initial movement |
|*| Added ball bouncing logic on wall collisions |
|*| Detected ball collisions with paddles |
|*| Detected when the ball goes out of bounds |
|*| Implemented scorekeeping and dynamic ball speed |

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- **OOP** makes game logic modular and easier to manage
- Real-time **event listeners** are critical in game development
- Consistent coordinate and boundary checks help manage game rules
- Adding speed variation increases challenge and engagement
