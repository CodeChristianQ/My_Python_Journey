# Day 20: Snake Game Part 1 – Animation & Coordinates

## 🐍 Overview

Today marks the beginning of building the classic Snake Game using Python and the `turtle` graphics library. The focus is on setting up animation, movement, and key controls using Object-Oriented Programming.

## 📚 Lessons Covered

1. **Day 20 Goals** – A brief on what we'll achieve by the end of the day.
2. **Screen Setup and Creating a Snake Body** – Learn how to initialize the screen and build the snake's initial structure using multiple turtle segments.
3. **Animating the Snake Segments on Screen** – Create a game loop to animate the snake moving forward smoothly.
4. **Create a Snake Class & Move to OOP** – Refactor the procedural code into a class-based structure for better scalability and organization.
5. **How to Control the Snake with a Keypress** – Enable snake movement via arrow key inputs and bind them using the `onkey()` method.
6. **Programming is not Memorising** – A motivational reminder that success in programming comes from practice, not memorization.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Using `turtle` graphics to create animations.
- Constructing and updating lists of turtle objects.
- Building a `Snake` class and handling state.
- Implementing infinite animation loops (`while` loops with `screen.update()`).
- Handling keypress events using `listen()` and `onkey()`.

## ✅ Personal Highlights

- Developed comfort using `turtle` to animate multi-part objects.
- Applied OOP principles to break logic into manageable parts.
- Practiced game loops and dynamic rendering with screen tracing.

## 🚀 Next Step

In **Day 21**, we’ll continue this project by adding food for the snake, tracking the score, and handling collisions.
