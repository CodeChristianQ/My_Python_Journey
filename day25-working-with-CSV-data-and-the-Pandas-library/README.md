# Day 25 – Intermediate: Working with CSV Data and the Pandas Library

## Overview
Day 25 introduced the Pandas library for Python and focused on working with CSV data.  
The lessons covered reading, analyzing, and manipulating data with Pandas, followed by practical projects that reinforced the concepts.  
By the end of the day, I built multiple projects that worked with real-world datasets and games that saved and loaded data from `.csv` files.
