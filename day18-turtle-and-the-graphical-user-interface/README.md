# Day 18: Turtle Graphics & The Hirst Painting Project ðŸŽ¨

## Overview
On **Day 18** of my 100 Days of Python challenge, I explored **Turtle Graphics** to create visual and interactive Python programs. This day focused on learning how to control the turtle module, work with loops, and draw complex patterns programmatically. The final project was the **Hirst Painting**, where I replicated a dotted artwork inspired by artist Damien Hirst using Python.

## Concepts Learned
- Introduction to **Turtle Graphics** and documentation usage
- Drawing basic shapes like **squares, dashed lines, and polygons**
- Using **for loops** and randomization for pattern generation
- Installing packages and working with **aliases**
- Drawing **spirographs and random walks**
- Extracting **RGB color values from images** using the `colorgram` module
- Generating a **dot painting** with a grid of randomly colored dots

---

## Project
### **ðŸŽ¯ The Hirst Painting**
- Extracted color data from an image using Python
- Created a 10x10 grid of colored dots
- Used `turtle` and `random` modules to automate the painting process
- Practiced working with the **RGB color mode** in Turtle Graphics

---

## Skills Strengthened
- Object-oriented thinking with Turtle
- Creating **custom functions** to improve code reusability
- Using **Python modules** and third-party packages
- Implementing **loop logic** for graphical outputs
- Managing coordinates for structured patterns

---

## Files in this folder
- `main.py` â†’ Contains all the turtle drawing code and final Hirst Painting project
- `hirst_spots_example.jpg` â†’ Script to extract and store RGB values (if used)
- Other supporting files as needed for the project

---

## Reflection
Day 18 was a fun and creative step in my Python journey. It demonstrated how programming can be used not just for problem-solving, but also for **artistic expression**. Working with Turtle Graphics strengthened my understanding of loops, functions, and external modules in a visual way.
