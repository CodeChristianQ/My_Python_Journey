# Day 9: Dictionaries, Nesting, and the Secret Auction

Today I explored one of Python’s most powerful data structures — the **dictionary** — and used it to build a fully interactive console-based bidding system: the **Secret Auction**.

This day emphasized storing and organizing data using keys and values, and introduced **nesting**, which allows dictionaries inside lists, and vice versa.

##  What I Learned

- **Dictionaries in Python** 
  Created, accessed, updated, and looped through dictionaries using keys and values.

- **Grading Program Exercise** 
  Transformed a dictionary of student scores into a dictionary of grade levels (`"Outstanding"`, `"Acceptable"`, etc.) using conditionals and loops.

- **Nesting Data** 
  Learned how to store complex data by nesting:
  - A dictionary within a dictionary
  - A list inside a dictionary
  - A dictionary inside a list

- **Flowcharting Logic** 
  Practiced breaking down a multi-step program into a clear flow before writing the code.

##  Final Project: Secret Auction Program

Built a command-line auction tool where:
- Each bidder enters their name and bid amount.
- The screen clears after each bidder to keep it secret.
- The program determines the highest bidder and announces the winner.

Used:
- Loops for repeated input
- Functions for organizing logic
- `os.system("clear")` / `cls` for terminal control
- Dictionary-based data collection

##  Reflection

This was the day dictionaries really “clicked.” Seeing how easily they can represent real-world data (like bids, grades, or travel logs) made me appreciate their flexibility. The Secret Auction was both fun and a perfect real-world application of everything I’ve learned up to this point.
