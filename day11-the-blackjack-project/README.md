# Day 11: The Blackjack Project 🃏

Day 11 was all about applying previously learned skills to build a **full command-line Blackjack game**. This was my first true capstone challenge where I practiced structuring logic, refining game flow, and thinking like a real developer.

---

##  What I Learned

- **Game Logic Design** 
  Broke the project down into phases: dealing cards, calculating scores, comparing results, and handling the Ace logic (1 or 11).

- **Functions & Composition** 
  Created reusable functions like `calculate_score()` to keep logic clean and testable.

- **Refactoring for Readability** 
  Improved messy or repetitive code by refactoring it into better structure as I went — not waiting until the end.

- **Using Lists and Randomization** 
  Modeled a deck of cards and randomly dealt cards to the user and computer using `random.choice()`.

- **Control Flow Practice** 
  Applied everything from loops to conditionals to let the user "hit" or "stand", and to determine win/loss/tie outcomes.

##  Final Project: Blackjack Game (CLI Version)

Features:
- Deals 2 cards to user and computer
- Allows user to take more cards until they stand or bust
- Calculates total score (with special handling for Aces and natural 21s)
- Compares results to determine the winner
- Offers option to play again

## Reflection

This project was an amazing step forward. It challenged me to apply logic from scratch and structure a complete game experience. I had to debug edge cases, manage function interactions, and think through user experience — all while reinforcing everything from the first 10 days.
