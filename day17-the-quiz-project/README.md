# Day 17 - The Quiz Project & Benefits of OOP

## Overview
On **Day 17** of my 100 Days of Python challenge, I built a **Quiz Game** to deepen my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
This project focused on creating and using custom Python classes to organize data, manage game logic, and build a structured quiz application.

## Skills and Concepts Practiced
- **Classes & Objects** – Designing custom classes to model quiz questions and quiz behavior.
- **Attributes & Constructors (`__init__`)** – Initializing data for each question and tracking game state.
- **Methods** – Implementing reusable functions inside classes to handle the quiz flow.
- **Importing and Managing Data** – Building a list of `Question` objects from provided question data.
- **Encapsulation** – Separating the question model from the quiz engine for clean, maintainable code.
- **Looping Through Questions** – Automatically iterating through a set of questions until the quiz ends.

## Features
- Displays one question at a time with multiple-choice answers (True/False).
- Checks player answers and keeps track of the score.
- Shows the final result at the end of the quiz.
- Demonstrates clean, modular OOP design principles.

## Key Takeaway
Day 17 highlighted the power of **Object-Oriented Programming** for organizing and scaling code efficiently.  
By splitting logic across different classes, the quiz game became more **readable, reusable, and easy to maintain**—a fundamental step toward real-world application development.
