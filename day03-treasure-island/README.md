# Day 3: Treasure Island Adventure

### Topics Covered:
- `if` / `else` conditional statements
- The `modulo` operator (`%`)
- Nested conditionals and `elif` branches
- Handling multiple `if` conditions
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)

### Project: Treasure Island Game

This day’s final challenge was to build a simple text-based adventure game called **Treasure Island**. The user is presented with a series of choices, and based on their input, they either reach the treasure or face an unexpected game-over scenario.

This exercise tested the ability to:
- Use conditional logic to control game flow
- Structure multiple branches and conditions
- Think through logic chains from a user perspective

### Files Included:
- `task.py` → My solution to the Treasure Island game
- `solution.py` → The official reference solution provided by the course
