# Day 12: Scope & Number Guessing Game

## Topics Covered
- Local vs. global scope in Python
- Python's lack of block scope
- Using the `global` keyword
- Constants and naming conventions
- Scope quizzes and exercises

## Coding Exercises

### Prime Number Checker
- A function that checks if a number is a prime.
- Practiced writing reusable functions and understanding scope rules.

### Scope Quiz
- Evaluated scenarios involving variable visibility and how Python handles variable scope in different contexts.

## Final Project: Number Guessing Game
A simple number guessing game where:
- A random number is generated
- The user is prompted to guess it
- Difficulty levels control how many attempts the user gets
- Game flow is managed using loops, conditionals, and function calls

This project reinforced:
- Function use and return values
- Managing state with variables across different scopes
- Proper structuring and debugging of game logic

## What I Learned
- The difference between local and global scope
- How and when to use the `global` keyword (and when to avoid it)
- Python treats functions as the primary scope boundary
- Built a complete, interactive Python project that involves user input and decision logic

## Files Included
- `prime_number_checker.py`
- `number_guessing_game.py`
- `README.md`
