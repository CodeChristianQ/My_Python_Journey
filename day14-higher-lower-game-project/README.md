# Day 14: Higher Lower Game Project

## Overview
This day focused on building a complete terminal-based Python game from scratch: the Higher Lower Game. The project solidified knowledge of logic, functions, loops, and user interactionâ€”all while practicing debugging and testing.

## Project: Higher Lower Game
The user is shown two Instagram-style profiles with follower counts hidden. The player must guess who has more followers. If correct, the game continues and their score increases. A wrong answer ends the game.

### Key Features:
- Random selection of account data from a dataset.
- Function-driven code structure with reusable logic blocks.
- Dynamic comparison of follower counts.
- User input handling and score tracking.
- Screen-clearing between rounds for cleaner display.

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Importing from external modules (`random`, `os` for screen clearing).
- Writing helper functions (`format_data`, `check_answer`, etc.).
- While loops and game state tracking.
- Reusability through function composition.
- Terminal UI formatting for game flow.

## Files Included
- `higher_lower.py`: Main project script.
- `game_data.py`: Dataset of social media accounts.
- `art.py`: Contains ASCII art for game interface.

## Takeaways
- Building a full game from scratch really reinforces logic flow.
- Organizing functionality into separate files/modules improves readability and maintainability.
- Simple games are a great way to gain confidence with core programming skills.
