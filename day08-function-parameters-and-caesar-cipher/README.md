# Day 8: Caesar Cipher & Function Parameters

Today’s focus was on mastering **function parameters**, including **positional and keyword arguments**, and using them to build a powerful text encryption tool — the **Caesar Cipher**.

This project showcased how to write clean, reusable, and well-structured functions while applying logical thinking and string manipulation skills.

##  What I Learned

- **Functions with Inputs** 
  Created functions that take user input, making code more dynamic and reusable.

- **Positional vs. Keyword Arguments** 
  Learned the differences between passing arguments in order versus by name for clarity and flexibility.

- **String Manipulation** 
  Used slicing, indexing, and loops to shift letters based on a given key value.

- **Modular Coding** 
  Broke down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable functions — ideal for debugging and readability.

##  Practice Exercises

- **Life in Weeks** 
  A function that calculates how many weeks you have left to live based on your current age — a great reminder to make each week count.

- **Love Calculator** 
  A fun, simple string-counting program that evaluates the "love compatibility" between two names using `count()`, `lower()`, and string concatenation.

##  Final Project: Caesar Cipher (3-Part Build)

1. **Encryption** 
   Shifted each letter in a message by a set amount (key), wrapping around the alphabet if needed.

2. **Decryption** 
   Reversed the encryption logic to recover the original message.

3. **Refactoring & Reusability** 
   Combined both features into a single, clean function. Allowed users to choose "encode" or "decode", and handled edge cases like large shift values.

##  Reflection

This was the most "real" coding day yet — I combined logic, user input, string operations, and modular programming into a single project that feels like a real-world tool. I'm getting more comfortable organizing code into clean, structured blocks.
