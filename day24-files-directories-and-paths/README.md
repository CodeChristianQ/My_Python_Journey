# Day 24 – Intermediate: Files, Directories, and Paths

## Overview
This day focused on learning how to work with files, directories, and paths in Python. We covered essential concepts for reading, writing, and managing files, as well as understanding file path systems. The day also included two practical coding challenges: **enhancing the Snake game with persistent high scores** and **completing the Mail Merge Project**.

## Key Achievements

### 1. File Reading & Writing
- Learned how to open, read, and write to files using Python's built-in functions.
- Practiced using the `with` keyword for better file handling, ensuring files close automatically.
- Explored different file modes (`"r"`, `"w"`, `"a"`) and their purposes.

### 2. Adding a High Score to the Snake Game
- Updated the existing Snake game to save the highest score achieved.
- Used file reading and writing to store the high score in a text file, ensuring it persists between game sessions.

### 3. Understanding File Paths
- Learned the difference between **absolute paths** and **relative paths**.
- Practiced navigating file systems in Python to correctly locate and manage files.
- Took a quiz to reinforce understanding of path usage.

### 4. Mail Merge Challenge
- Used file handling to create personalized letters from a template.
- Automated the process of merging contact data with prewritten text, generating custom output files.
- Reinforced the concept of iterating over file data and writing multiple outputs.
