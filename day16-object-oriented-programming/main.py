# From Day 16 onwards, you will be creating your own PyCharm projects from scratch.
# Instead of using templates that I have created for you.
# It will be another step in your journey as a developer!
# But don't worry, I will explain how to do everything in the video tutorials on Udemy.

# This is a sample Python script.

# Press Ctrl+F5 to execute it or replace it with your code.
# Press Double Shift to search everywhere for classes, files, tool windows, actions, and settings.


def print_hi(name):
    # Use a breakpoint in the code line below to debug your script.
    print(f'Hi, {name}')  # Press F9 to toggle the breakpoint.


# Press the green button in the gutter to run the script.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print_hi('PyCharm')
