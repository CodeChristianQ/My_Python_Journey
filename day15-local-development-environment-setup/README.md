# Day 15: Coffee Machine Project & Local Development Setup

## Overview
Day 15 marked a turning point in the course by introducing the use of local development environments for building larger projects. This lesson also included a fully functional coffee machine simulator to practice logic flow and data handling.

## Project: Coffee Machine Simulation
This console-based program simulates a coffee machine that:
- Offers espresso, latte, or cappuccino.
- Checks for sufficient resources.
- Processes coins and returns change.
- Updates resource levels after each purchase.
- Offers a report feature for checking inventory and profit.
- Has a hidden `off` switch for turning off the machine.

## Key Features
- Menu-driven system using loops and conditionals.
- Resource tracking via dictionary data structures.
- Coin calculation using arithmetic operations.
- Function decomposition for clean, readable code.

## Key Concepts Practiced
- Local development in PyCharm.
- Reusability through function-based programming.
- Simulating real-world systems with conditional logic.
- Managing state through variable updates.
- User input validation and conversion.

## Files Included
- `main.py`: Contains the entire coffee machine program.
- `menu.py` and `resources.py`: May be included if project was broken into multiple modules (based on course guidance).

## Takeaways
- Transitioning to local development prepares for real-world workflows.
- Building stateful systems reinforces core logic and program design.
- This was a strong project to reinforce foundational knowledge before moving into more complex challenges.
