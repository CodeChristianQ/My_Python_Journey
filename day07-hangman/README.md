# Day 7: Hangman Game – Project Build Using Cumulative Python Skills

For Day 7 of the 100 Days of Python challenge, I applied all the foundational skills acquired so far to build a fully functional **Hangman game** in Python. This was my first larger-scale project, combining logic, user interaction, and control flow into a cohesive program.

##  What I Used

This project brought together concepts from Days 1–6, including:

- **Variables & Data Types** 
  Used to store and manipulate guesses, word lists, and game state.

- **Random Module** 
  Used `random.choice()` to select a word for the player to guess.

- **Lists** 
  Maintained the current display of the guessed word using a list of underscores and letters.

- **For and While Loops** 
  Repeatedly checked user guesses and updated the display until the game was won or lost.

- **Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)** 
  Handled player guesses, win/loss logic, and game progress.

- **Functions** 
  Built reusable components to handle different parts of the game logic cleanly.

- **User Input** 
  Took guesses from the user and displayed the updated state of the word and remaining lives.

##  What the Game Does

- Picks a random word from a predefined list.
- Displays the word as blanks that get filled in when the player guesses correctly.
- Tracks the number of lives left and ends the game when the player runs out.
- Provides feedback for incorrect or duplicate guesses.
- Uses ASCII art (optional) to visualize the Hangman progression.

##  Key Learnings

- How to break a complex problem into smaller, manageable steps using a **flow chart**.
- How to structure a growing codebase by using **functions and clear logic**.
- Reinforced the importance of **incremental testing and debugging**.
- Built a user-friendly experience by improving output formatting and gameplay flow.

##  Reflection

This was the most satisfying day so far — I built something tangible by stitching together multiple Python concepts I've been learning day by day. Seeing it work and refining it was a big confidence booster!
