# Day 6: Python Functions, Indentation, and Karel the Robot Challenges

Today’s focus was all about mastering **functions**, understanding **Python’s indentation rules**, and solving increasingly complex problems using **`while` loops** and **custom logic**.

##  What I Learned

- **Defining and Calling Functions** 
  Practiced creating reusable blocks of code with `def`, passing arguments, and understanding function scope and flow.

- **Python Indentation** 
  Learned how critical proper indentation is in Python, especially within function definitions and loops.

- **While Loops** 
  Used `while` loops to solve problems where repeated logic is needed until a condition is met.

##  Practice & Challenges

- **Hurdles Loop Challenge** 
  Navigated a robot over a series of hurdles using loops and conditions.

- **Hurdles with While Loops** 
  Solved dynamic challenges where hurdles varied in position or frequency, applying `while` logic.

- **Hurdles with Variable Heights** 
  Handled more complex obstacle courses where each hurdle could be a different height.

- **Final Maze Project** 
  Built logic to help Karel escape a maze using `while` loops and directional decision-making.

##  Key Concepts Reinforced

- Importance of clean and correct **code indentation**
- Looping until an **unknown endpoint** (`while` vs `for`)
- Writing efficient, **reusable functions**
- How to **think like a programmer**: breaking problems down into repeatable steps

##  Reflection

This day really tested my logical thinking. The maze project was a big leap in complexity, but it helped cement how control flow and loop conditions work in real-world problem solving.
