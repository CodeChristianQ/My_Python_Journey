# Day 21 ‚Äì Build the Snake Game Part 2: Inheritance & List Slicing

Today‚Äôs focus was on expanding the Snake game by implementing **object-oriented programming** concepts like **inheritance**, alongside more advanced logic such as **collision detection** and **list slicing**.

## üêç Key Concepts Covered

- **Class Inheritance**  
  Learned how to create a new class that inherits properties and methods from an existing class ‚Äî a core OOP concept that improves code reusability.

- **Quiz: Inheritance Quiz**  
  Tested understanding of how inheritance works in Python.

- **Collision Detection**  
  - With Food: Detected when the snake head comes in contact with food, triggering growth and score increase.
  - With Wall: Implemented game-over logic when the snake hits the wall boundaries.
  - With Tail: Created logic for self-collision to end the game if the snake hits its own body.

- **Scoreboard**  
  Built a scoreboard using Turtle to keep track of the player‚Äôs score in real time.

- **List & Tuple Slicing**  
  Explored powerful Python slicing techniques to manipulate sequences, especially for managing the snake body parts.

## üí° Motivation Reminder

Wrapped up the day with a motivational tip to reflect on *why* I started this journey in the first place ‚Äî a great way to stay focused.
