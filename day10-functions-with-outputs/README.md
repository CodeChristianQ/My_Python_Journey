# Day 10: Functions with Outputs & Building a Calculator

Today was all about stepping up my understanding of **functions**, especially how to return values and build modular, flexible logic. I also created my first fully functional **command-line calculator**, applying everything I’ve learned so far.

##  What I Learned

- **Functions with Return Values** 
  Used `return` to pass data back to the caller, rather than just printing.

- **Multiple Return Values** 
  Learned how to return more than one value using tuples, and unpack them into variables.

- **Docstrings** 
  Wrote documentation directly inside functions to explain what they do — super useful for readability and future reference.

- **Function Reusability** 
  Created small, single-purpose functions that can be combined to build larger programs.

##  Practice Exercises

- **Leap Year Checker** 
  Wrote a function to determine if a year is a leap year using logical conditionals and modulo arithmetic.

##  Final Project: Command-Line Calculator

Created an interactive calculator that:
- Takes user input for numbers and operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Repeats until the user chooses to exit
- Allows the result of one calculation to be reused in the next
- Uses a function for each operation and a loop to keep the session going

This project helped me:
- Think through **control flow**
- Handle **user input**
- Chain logic and values between function calls

##  Reflection

Today felt like a big step toward building programs that do real things — not just simple scripts. Being able to return values and reuse logic makes my code cleaner, more readable, and easier to build on.
